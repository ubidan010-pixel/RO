## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


Game Engine Architecture with Specialized Business Components:

1. Physics and Movement System
- Custom animation-driven movement with bone-based collision detection
- Specialized air/ground/water transitions with state machine
- Node-based pathfinding with trajectory prediction
- Character-specific movement modifications

2. Combat System Architecture
- Multi-phase boss fights with weak point targeting
- Faction-based damage calculation and hit detection
- Complex combo system with timing windows
- Specialized attack patterns per enemy type

3. AI Behavior Framework 
- Phase-based boss AI with pattern recognition
- Swarm behavior system for grouped enemies
- Environmental awareness with custom trigger zones
- State-based enemy behaviors with transition rules

4. Game World Management
- Cell-based world partitioning with depth layers
- Dynamic resource loading based on visibility
- Custom checkpoint and respawn system
- Specialized camera control per game mode

Key Integration Points:
- Animation system coordinates with physics for smooth transitions
- AI behaviors integrate with combat system for enemy attacks
- World management connects with physics for environmental interactions
- Camera system adapts to different gameplay modes

The architecture emphasizes modular components while maintaining tight integration for gameplay mechanics. Each subsystem contains specialized logic for platform-style gameplay while supporting core game requirements.

Critical Workflows:
1. Character Movement Pipeline
- Input processing → State determination → Physics application → Animation selection
- Specialized handling for different movement types and environmental conditions

2. Combat Processing Chain  
- Hit detection → Damage calculation → Health modification → State updates
- Enemy-specific modifications and boss fight mechanics

3. AI Decision Making
- Environment analysis → Behavior selection → Action execution → State updates
- Custom patterns for different enemy types

The system implements a comprehensive game engine focused on platformer mechanics with emphasis on smooth character control and engaging combat.
