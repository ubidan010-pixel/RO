## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The codebase implements a sophisticated game engine with several key business logic components:

CORE GAMEPLAY SYSTEMS (Importance: 90/100)
- Multi-phase boss battle management with synchronized music states
- Specialized creature AI with node-based movement patterns 
- Multi-player scaling system for health and difficulty
- Complex checkpoint and reward distribution mechanics
- Dynamic music control tied to gameplay events

AI AND BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT (Importance: 85/100)
- Custom swarm behavior system using particle-based simulation
- Advanced flocking algorithms for fish swarm coordination
- Music-synchronized enemy behaviors with timing events
- Context-aware NPC interactions and quest management
- Node-based enemy positioning and attack pattern control

WORLD MANAGEMENT (Importance: 80/100)
- Cell-based world loading with multi-layer support
- Dynamic object activation based on player proximity
- Platform-specific memory optimization for world data
- Specialized checkpoint and game state persistence
- Complex scene transitions with state preservation

PHYSICS AND MOVEMENT (Importance: 75/100)
- Custom water physics implementation for buoyancy
- Specialized platform movement along bezier curves
- Advanced bouncing mechanics with material properties
- Complex character controller with state-based movement
- Rope/string physics with tension simulation

Key implementation paths:
- rayman/gameplay/Components/AI/Boss/* - Core boss battle logic
- rayman/gameplay/Components/AI/Shooter/* - Enemy AI systems
- rayman/gameplay/GameScreens/* - Game state management
- rayman/gameplay/Components/Common/* - Core gameplay mechanics

The business logic emphasizes:
- Rich gameplay mechanics with music integration
- Sophisticated AI behaviors and enemy patterns
- Complex physics and movement systems
- Optimized world management for game consoles
