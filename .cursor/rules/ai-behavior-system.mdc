# ai-behavior-system

Core Behavior Tree System:
- Node-based AI decision making with specialized node types (Sequence, Selector, Decorator)
- Blackboard data sharing between tree nodes for coordinated decision making
- Custom state machine integration for behavior transitions
- Event-driven behavior interruption system

Movement and Positioning:
- Path finding using navigation nodes with movement type constraints (walk, jump, wall-run)
- Node-based positioning with bone attachments and relative transforms
- Complex spline-based movement along bezier curves
- Multi-layer collision detection with terrain adaptation

Combat Behaviors:
- Multi-phase attack patterns with timing windows
- Faction-based targeting and aggression system
- Hit chain management with combo validation
- Range-based engagement rules with positioning requirements

Boss Battle Logic:
- Phase-based progression with synchronized music states
- Dynamic difficulty scaling based on player count
- Specialized attack patterns tied to boss phases
- Vulnerability window management and damage states

Key Components:

1. Boss Battle Management System (Importance: 85)
Path: rayman/gameplay/Components/AI/Boss/Ray_BossBirdAIComponent.cpp
- Controls multi-phase boss behaviors
- Manages reward spawning based on phase completion
- Coordinates music synchronization with battle states

2. Hunter Boss AI (Importance: 80)
Path: rayman/gameplay/Components/AI/Shooter/Ray_HunterBossAIComponent.cpp
- Implements node-based positioning system
- Controls attack patterns and vulnerability states
- Manages player detection and targeting

3. Fish Swarm AI (Importance: 90)
Path: rayman/gameplay/AI/Behaviors/FishSwarm/Ray_FishSwarmAIComponent.cpp
- Advanced flocking behavior with player interaction
- Multi-layered depth management
- Dynamic speed adjustment based on player proximity

4. Enemy Ground Movement (Importance: 85)
Path: rayman/gameplay/AI/Behaviors/Ground/Ray_AIGroundAttackBehavior.cpp
- Complex terrain navigation with slope detection
- Attack radius and targeting system
- State transitions between roam/attack/retreat
