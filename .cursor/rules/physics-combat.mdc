# physics-combat

Core Combat Physics System:
1. Hit Detection and Response
Path: rayman/gameplay/Components/AI/Combat/Ray_CombatPhysics.cpp
- Custom layer-based hit detection with phantom shapes
- Progressive damage calculation based on hit chains
- Hit response system with force application and knockback
- Specialized collision groups for combat vs. environment
Importance Score: 90

2. Movement Physics
Path: rayman/gameplay/Components/AI/Physics/Ray_MovementPhysics.cpp
- Non-linear jump curves with variable gravity
- Surface-aware movement with friction coefficients
- Momentum preservation during platform transitions
- Custom air control physics for mid-jump adjustments
Importance Score: 85

3. Collision Resolution
Path: rayman/gameplay/Components/AI/Collision/Ray_CollisionManager.cpp
- Multi-phase collision detection for moving objects
- Custom sweep tests for continuous collision detection
- Specialized collision response for combat vs. movement
- Priority-based collision resolution for overlapping hits
Importance Score: 80

4. Combat Zone System
Path: rayman/gameplay/Components/AI/Combat/Ray_CombatZoneManager.cpp
- Dynamic combat arena boundaries
- Zone-based modifier system for physics properties
- Combat-specific gravity and movement adjustments
- Arena state management affecting physics behavior
Importance Score: 75
