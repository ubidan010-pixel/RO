Core Combat Physics Components:

1. Hit Detection System
Location: rayman/gameplay/Components/AI/Boss/Ray_BuboComponent.h

Key mechanics:
- Weak point hit registration with multi-phase damage states
- Point-based collision detection optimized for fast-moving projectiles 
- Zone-based damage multipliers
- Hit confirmation with visual/audio feedback

2. Physics-Based Combat Movement
Location: rayman/gameplay/Components/AI/Hunter/Ray_HunterBossAIComponent.h

Combat movement mechanics:
- Node-based movement patterns with combat state transitions
- Attack trajectory calculations with player prediction
- Physics-driven attack animations
- Vacuum influence mechanics affecting projectile paths

3. Multi-Stage Boss Combat
Location: rayman/gameplay/Components/AI/Boss/Ray_BossPlantArenaAIComponent.h

Combat physics implementation:
- Phase-based damage states with position tracking
- Coordinated hit zone activation/deactivation
- Bubo (weak point) physics with detachment mechanics
- Impact force calculations for visual feedback

4. Projectile Physics
Location: rayman/gameplay/Components/AI/Bullet/Ray_BasicBullet.cpp

Projectile mechanics:
- Material-specific bounce behaviors
- Faction-based collision filtering
- Multi-hit detection with damage propagation
- Auto-seeking capability using custom physics calculations

Core concepts focus on:
- Physics-driven combat interactions
- Multi-phase damage systems
- Specialized collision detection for combat
- Complex movement patterns tied to combat states
