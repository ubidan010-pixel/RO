# memory-management

Core Memory Management Components:

1. Bucket Allocation System
Path: core/memory/MemMng/MemMngBuckets.cpp
- Custom bucket-based memory allocation optimized for game object pooling
- Fixed-size buckets from 16 bytes to 4KB with power-of-2 progression
- Smart coalescing of adjacent free blocks within same bucket
- Separate bucket arrays for alignment requirements (4/8/16/32/64 bytes)
Importance Score: 90

2. Platform-Specific Memory Management 
Path: core/memory/MemMng/MemMngPage_PS5.cpp
Path: core/memory/MemMng/MemMngPage_Nintendo.cpp
- Custom memory page management for gaming consoles
- Garlic/Onion memory optimization for PS5 hardware
- Split memory handling for Nintendo MEM1/MEM2 regions
- Direct memory mapping with hardware-specific protection flags
Importance Score: 85

3. VRAM Management System
Path: adapters/GFXAdapter_PS5/VRAMAllocator/
- Specialized video memory allocation with defragmentation
- Texture-optimized memory pools with custom alignment
- Relocatable memory blocks for dynamic defragmentation
- Death row system for delayed memory deallocation
Importance Score: 95

4. Memory Pool Architecture
Path: core/memory/allocator/pool.h
- Fixed-size block pools from 4-128 bytes
- Bit field tracking for allocation status
- Pool buffer organization in 4KB chunks
- Fast constant-time allocation/deallocation
Importance Score: 80

Key Features:
- Hardware-specific memory optimization
- Video memory defragmentation
- Multi-pool memory architecture
- Bucket-based allocation strategy
