# memory-management

Three-tier Memory Management System
Importance Score: 85/100

1. Bucket-based Small Allocation System
- Size-based bucket allocation strategy for small blocks (4-128 bytes)
- Custom binning algorithm with pre-calculated optimal bucket sizes
- Memory quarantine system for corruption detection
- Smart coalescence for fragmentation prevention
- Thread-safe free list management per bucket
- Platform-specific alignment requirements

2. Large Block Management 
- Direct memory mapping for large allocations (>64KB)
- Chunk-based management with physical memory tracking
- Custom defragmentation through block merging
- Platform-optimized page size selection

3. Platform-Specific Memory Systems

PS3 Implementation:
- Specialized allocation for RSX graphics memory
- Z-culling region management (8 max regions)
- Custom binning for DXT1/DXT5 textures
- Report IO memory area handling (0x0E000000-0x0F000000)

Nintendo Switch:
- Custom VRAM management with tiled allocation
- Memory pool segregation for graphics resources
- Death row system for delayed deallocation
- Dynamic pool expansion handling

PlayStation 5:
- Read-only vs read-write memory segregation
- Memory bus-specific allocation (DIRECT vs other)
- Custom defragmentation for graphics memory
- Thread-safe memory pool management

Core Domain Features:
- Game-specific memory pooling optimizations
- Console hardware memory constraints handling
- Graphics resource-aware memory management
- Custom debugging and corruption detection
